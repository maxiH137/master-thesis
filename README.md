## Ackownledgement
For the model training the TAL repository by Marius Bock is used as well as the WEAR dataset (https://github.com/mariusbock/tal_for_har).
The label reconstruction attacks are evaluated with the breaching repository by Geiping et al. (https://github.com/JonasGeiping/breaching).
Additional attacks are added from Ma et al. (https://github.com/BUAA-CST/iLRG) and Gat et al. (https://github. com/nadbag98/LLBG).
